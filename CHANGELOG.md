### Bug Fixes

* **ci:** change npm to yarn ([77040af](https://github.com/event-store/event-store/commit/77040af1878dc11f115f7fd6f0bce7286d279699))
* creating new model from virtual model causes an issue with event firing. The last one registered only was executed ([3fb8c55](https://github.com/event-store/event-store/commit/3fb8c551e9784e82b2c41f07d3df87ade949509b))
